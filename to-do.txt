1.) Separate the SWR and efficiency calculations. SWR starts at 1 and goes up by 0.5 per incorrect block length.
2.) SWR of connected antennas should impact static volume.
3.) Remove de-click from PTT button-- hard to keep morse rhythm.
4.) Implement VHF radio BEs and UIs.
5.) Implement VHF antenna blocks.
6.) Implement VHF audio transmission (should already be mostly functional, just need to hook into it).
7.) Make band-edge light on QRP radios work.
8.) Add per-band multiplier for propagation events.
9.) Fix charge controllers always outputting max power.
10.) Add wide band receive antenna.
11.) Stop radios from receiving and transmitting CW at the same time.
12.) Fix the GUI desync on radios when they first load in.
13.) Implement repeaters.
